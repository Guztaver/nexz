# NEXZ [api]

Here contains the api of the `NEXZ` project.
The api is based on [Java 21](https://jdk.java.net/21/), and uses the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io).

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

or in Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```

## Building

To build the project, simply run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

or in Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
